                    <strong>What is DebounceTime in RxJS?<br>Answer:</strong>
                    debounceTime is an RxJS operator that delays the emission of values from an observable for a specified duration, effectively filtering out rapid emissions and only allowing the last value to pass through after the specified time has elapsed.

                    <strong>What is pipe operator?<br>Answer:</strong>
                    The pipe operator in RxJS is a method that allows you to compose multiple operators together in a clean and readable way, enabling you to transform, filter, or manipulate the data emitted by an observable.

                    <strong>What is distinctUntilChanged operator?<br>Answer:</strong>
                    The distinctUntilChanged operator in RxJS emits only the first value from the source observable and subsequent values only if they are different from the last emitted value, effectively filtering out consecutive duplicates.

                    <strong>What is filter operator in RxJS?<br>Answer:</strong>
                    The filter operator in RxJS allows you to selectively emit values from an observable based on a provided predicate function, which determines whether each emitted value should be included. This operator is useful for creating more focused streams by excluding unwanted values.
